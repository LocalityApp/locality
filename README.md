# locality

### Status
<img src="https://travis-ci.com/LocalityApp/locality.svg?branch=master"/>

A neighborhood based web application for suiting perpective residents with their ideal locality.  This project was conceived for part of the University of Denver Coding Bootcamp - May thru Nov 2018 Cohort.  

Deployed Web App for Locality is built on NodeJS, Express, Handlebars and MongoDB.  The front-end work is based on Bootstrap 4. **Refactor into React Coming Soon!**

Within the org GitHub account we have some utilities used to generate content for the locality scoring mechanism.  

Please send any comments or questions to Locality.App.Team@gmail.com

Thanks,
Jacob, Katelyn, Sara, and Schuyler
